# Polymarket Public Pages

Public pages:

- `/` is the Chinese-first landing page.
- `/polymarket` is the primary Polymarket market feed.
- `/polymarket/[slug]` is the market detail page.
- `/ambassador`, `/rewards`, and admin review pages support the referral and Builder-fee disclosure funnel.

Public API map:

- `GET /external/markets` returns safe public Polymarket market records for browsing.
- `GET /external/markets/:source/:externalId` returns one safe public market by source plus external ID or slug.
- `GET /external/markets/:source/:externalId/orderbook` returns latest captured orderbook snapshots, or `{ orderbook: [] }`.
- `GET /external/markets/:source/:externalId/trades` returns imported recent ticks, or `{ trades: [] }`.
- `GET /external/markets/:source/:externalId/history` returns chart-safe points derived from imported public trade ticks, or `{ history: [] }`.
- `GET /external/markets/:source/:externalId/stats` returns volume/liquidity/spread/freshness metadata.

Market data rules:

- Do not scrape Polymarket.
- Use existing external market tables first when available.
- If no usable persisted Polymarket data exists, use the official/public Gamma API fallback for discovery.
- CLOB/orderbook/trade reads are optional and must degrade to safe empty states.
- Price, volume, liquidity, depth, and recent-trade charts must use only persisted public sync data or official/public Polymarket API responses. If history is unavailable, show empty chart copy instead of demo data.
- Missing `POLY_BUILDER_CODE` must not break browsing.
- Market browsing is read-only and available without login.

Chart surfaces:

- `/` shows trending market sparklines when recent imported ticks exist.
- `/polymarket` shows market-card sparklines, `MiniMetricTrend` volume/liquidity metrics, and close-state progress.
- `/polymarket/[slug]` shows `PriceHistoryChart`, `VolumeHistoryChart`, `LiquidityHistoryChart`, `OrderBookDepthChart`, and `RecentTradesChart`.
- `/ambassador`, `/rewards`, and admin pages show `ReferralFunnelChart`, `RewardSplitChart`, and `PayoutStatusChart` from internal referral accounting records only.
- Missing history/orderbook/trades render zh-HK empty states: `暫時未有圖表資料`, `市場走勢資料暫時未能更新`, `訂單簿資料暫時未有`, or `成交資料暫時未有`.
- Production pages must not use random demo chart data or hardcoded fake price history. Test fixtures may exist only in tests/stories and must stay isolated from runtime pages.

Trading boundary:

- `POLYMARKET_ROUTED_TRADING_ENABLED=false` by default.
- Live routed trading must stay disabled unless user-owned signing, L2 credentials, and submitter flow are production-safe.
- Users sign their own orders. The platform does not custody Polymarket funds and does not place trades for users.
- External Polymarket activity must not mutate internal trading ledgers or balances.
- The trade ticket is a readiness shell. Actual order submission remains disabled unless every user-signing, L2 credential, submitter, Builder Code, and operational gate is production-safe.

Reward and payout boundary:

- Rewards are accounting records only and must not be presented as trading balance.
- Pending/payable/paid states must remain visible in zh-HK copy.
- Polygon pUSD payout copy must state that payouts are manual and admin-approved.
- No automatic treasury transfer is enabled by public pages, reward pages, payout pages, or chart endpoints.

Builder disclosure:

- Pending Maker Builder fee disclosure: 0.5%.
- Pending Taker Builder fee disclosure: 1%.
- Disclosure values are not authoritative settlement values; settlement must come from confirmed Polymarket Builder revenue.
- Builder Code attribution only applies to eligible, matched routed Polymarket orders. Browsing never creates Builder fees.

## Public API Boundary

Public market browsing is served by isolated read-only API route handlers: `/api/health`, `/api/version`, `/api/external/markets`, and `/api/external/markets/:source/:externalId/*`.

These routes do not require login. If privileged Supabase/admin configuration is unavailable, list routes return safe empty arrays or fallback public market data, and detail routes return `{ market: null }` with 404. They must never expose service-role errors, SQL details, connection strings, stack traces, or environment values.

Authenticated user and admin command routes stay separate and protected. Public external market routes do not mutate the internal ledger, balances, withdrawals, or reward payouts.
